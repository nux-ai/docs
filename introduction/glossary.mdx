#### Chain
A core concept in the NUX platform, a chain is a series of stages linked together. You can link the output of searches into the input of models with any combination to build impressive, custom AI workflows.

#### Stage
Stages are blocks of logic that combine to form a chain. They can be searches, text_to_text models, text_to_image, and so on. See the FAQ page for a comprehensive list of supported models.

#### Source
Sources are how you customize NUX chains with your own data. They can be files, websites, and more. See the FAQ for a comprehensive list. 

#### Iterator
Some inputs are too large to process through models so you need to use steppers. Steppers are ways of splitting up an input (for example a video) into parts, and running each part through a chain.

#### Deployment
Once your chain is ready and you're happy with the results, you can deploy it using one of 3 methods: 
- API
- ChatBot
- WebHook
- Dedicated Hub
