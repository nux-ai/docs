Workflows allow you to run batch processes of your workbook. 

For example, say you want to run a CSV through your workbook. You can simply upload your CSV to the workflow endpoint: `https://api.nux.ai/v1/workflows/workbook/{WORKBOOK_ID}`.

This will return your `workflow_id`, like: 

```json
{
    "workflow_id": "0cdd2e96-c890-4e6c-a5f0-7de639d030c0"
}
```

This will then open an asynchronous task queue.

You can then poll the status of this queue via `https://api.nux.ai/v1/workflows/status/{WORKFLOW_ID}`
