With the execption of `tools`, blocks are stateless, executable, modular blocks of logic. 
They can be _database queries_, _model inference_ or generic _python glue code_. 

All blocks have `inputs`, `settings`, and a `response_output`.

## Inputs

This is what you provide to the block, it can be prompts, queries, inputs and more.

## Settings

Settings are how you define things like hyperparameters for models, embedding models for DB queries, and libraries for python code.

## Response Output

Output you'd like the block to adhere to. This is critical to ensuring each block's execution consistency.

## Variables

Every block has access to `parameters`, and `blocks`.

### Parameters

When calling your workbook, you send parameters via HTTP like:

```sh
curl --location 'https://api.nux.ai/v1/run/workbook/{WORKBOOK_ID}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}' \
--data '{
    "parameters": {
        "key": "value"
    }
}'
```

You can then access the the key's value in your blocks via standard handlebar tags: `{{parameters.key}}`

### Blocks

This is the execution context of the workbook. Similar to how when you build a Jupyter notebook of cells, the variables are shared between eachother. You can pass these variables via `{{blocks.cell_name.key}}`
