Blocks are contained pieces of logic that can consist of data, model or code.

All blocks have `inputs`, `settings`, and `response_output`

## Inputs

Inputs for the block

## Settings

Settings for the block

## Response Output

Output you'd like the block to adhere to. This is critical to ensuring each block's execution durability. 


## Variables


Every block has access to `parameters`, and `blocks`.

### Parameters

When calling your workbook, you send parameters via HTTP like:

```sh
curl --location 'https://api.nux.ai/v1/run/workbook/{WORKBOOK_ID}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}' \
--data '{
    "parameters": {
        "key": "value"
    }
}'
```

You can then access the the key's value in your blocks via standard handlebar tags: `{{parameters.key}}`

### Blocks

This is the execution context of the workbook. Similar to how when you build a Jupyter notebook of cells, the variables are shared between eachother. You can pass these variables via `{{blocks.cell_name.key}}`
