### Selecting an Embedding Model

The easiest option here is to select amongst Huggingface's `SentenceTransformers` library, this allows you to pop it into your python code via:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-minilm-l6-v2')
```

Select an embedding model amongst the list here: https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=sentence-similarity&sort=downloads


### Creating a MongoDB Vector Index

Depending on the embedding model you selected, you'll need to define the index definition. So if the model is 768 dimensions, you'll specifigy it like:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": true,
    "fields": {
      "plot_embedding_768": {
        "dimensions": 768,
        "similarity": "euclidean",
        "type": "knnVector"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`plot_embedding_768` in this case is any field that contains the 768 dimension array. 

Consult the MongoDB Vector search docs to understand the various similarity options of `euclidian`, `dotproduct` and `cosine`.

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/#atlas-vector-search-index

### Indexing Data

Using the SentenceTransformer imported above, iterate through whichever dataset you want, encode each and simply insert.  

<Note>Make sure the field you're inserting the encoded array into is the same dimension count</Note>

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

# Initialize the SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-minilm-l6-v2')

# Grab connection string from env variabl
connection_string = os.getenv('mdb')

# Connect to MongoDB and use default loaded data
client = MongoClient(connection_string)
db = client['sample_mflix']
collection = db['embedded_movies']


async def encode(self, text):
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    embedding = await loop.run_in_executor(None, model.encode, [text])
    return embedding[0].tolist()


# Get all documents
documents = collection.find()

# Update each document
for doc in documents:
    print(doc['title'])
    if 'plot' not in doc:
        continue
    embedding = model.encode([doc['plot']])[0].tolist()
    collection.update_one(
        {'_id': doc['_id']},
        {'$set': {'plot_embedding_768': embedding}}
    )
```

### Building your Workbook

1. First add the MongoDB block:

<img src="../../../images/mdb_block.png"/>


2. Then specify the embedding model you'll use

Provide your connection string (end to end encrypted, consult our [security](https://nux.ai/security) page to learn more), database and collection.

3. Now write the query.

Note, we're including the `{{paarameters.query}}` variable here, and wrapping it in quotes. Consult the [Block Intros Page](/main/blocks/intro) to understand variable syntax.

```json
[
  {
    '$vectorSearch': {
      'index': 'default',
      'path': 'plot_embedding_384',
      'queryVector': "{{parameters.query}}",
      'numCandidates': 150,
      'limit': 10
    }
  },
  {
    '$project':
    {
      'plot': 1, 'title' : 1
    }
  }
]
```

4. Read em and weep the results, note the runtime :)
