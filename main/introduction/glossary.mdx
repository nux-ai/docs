### Workbooks
A NUX Workbook organizes and links blocks within a workflow. It's a platform for creating, managing, and executing complex workflows, offering customization to suit different data processing and analytical needs. 
Workbooks can be versioned, configured and deployed then executed via API. 

### Blocks
Blocks are the building blocks of NUX Workbooks. They are capable of performing functions like code execution, model inference, or data integrations. Blocks are designed to be interconnected, facilitating the creation of complex, multi-step workflows.

When importing blocks, users select `versions` and can be configured then run within a workbook or standalone. Each time you run a block, a replayable `snapshot` is saved.

# Block Types

### Model Inference
Model Inference in NUX Workbooks involves using machine learning models for data analysis and predictions. It enables the application of algorithms like language models or image recognition within a workflow.

### Code Execution
The Code Execution Blocks in NUX Workbooks allows for running custom code, supporting various programming languages. It's used for data manipulation, transformation, and specific computational tasks.

### Data Integration
The Data Integration Blocks in NUX Workbooks enables connecting to and using data from different sources, including KNN data stores, external APIs, and databases. It's crucial for integrating external data for analysis, decision-making, and automation in real-time workflows.
