Under the hood, workbooks are an LLM-powered DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). 
Each block in the workbook is a stateless `node` in the DAG, where the output of other blocks and the workbook's request parameters (when called) are the `edges`.

This is powerful because if a block's execution fails other blocks can still run if they don't depend on the block that failed.

To run a workbook, simply send parameters to `/v1/run` with your `workbook_id`:

```sh
curl --location 'https://api.nux.ai/v1/run/workbook/{WORKBOOK_ID}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}' \
--data '{
    "parameters": {
        "url": "s3://some_file_url.pdf"
    }
}'
```

Once complete it will return an array of objects that contain each block's output:

```json
{
    "created_at": "2024-01-12T20:30:17.585000",
    "data": [
        {
            "block_id": "1a5e71",
            "cell_name": "extract_content",
            "response": "lorem ipsum...",
            "metadata": {
                "block_type": "code",
                "block_subtype": "python",
                "content_type": "text/plain",
                "runtime": 1583.775390625
            },
            "run_at": "2024-01-12T20:30:19.883000"
        },
        {

            "response": {},

            },
            "run_at": "2024-01-12T20:30:28.668000"
        }
    ],

}

### Streaming

When you call a workbook, sometimes it can take longer to run. To receive streaming updates open and listen in on a `websocket` via `/ws/`

See the websocket page for more details: [Websockets](/main/workbooks/websockets)
